### Open Weather Map API Key is required.

In order for the Weather Live app to function properly, an API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build.

We recommend to obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://openweathermap.org/appid#use), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
